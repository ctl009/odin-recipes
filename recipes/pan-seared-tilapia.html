        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tilapia fillets</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season 
                both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the flour to 
                coat and shake off any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia 
                fillets in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until fish flakes easily 
                with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Brush the melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute before 
                removing from the skillet.</li>
